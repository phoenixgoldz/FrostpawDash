Source code for a tutorial/sample game/starter kit about creating an infinite 3D runner game in Unity (like Temple Run, Subway Surfers).

## **Project Enhancements & Refactor**
This project has been updated to improve performance, maintainability, and scalability. The following changes have been implemented:

### **Implemented Features**
- **Object Pooling:** Improved performance by reusing objects instead of instantiating and destroying them frequently.
- **Modularized Code Structure:** Separated game mechanics into independent components for better maintainability.
- **Upgraded to URP (Universal Render Pipeline):** Enhanced graphics quality and rendering performance.
- **Improved UI & Navigation:** Updated user interface with responsive layouts and intuitive menu navigation.

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Power-Up System:** Add dynamic power-ups that affect player abilities.
- **Level Progression System:** Introduce increasing difficulty and new level challenges.
