## **Overview**  
**Frostpaw Dash** is an endless runner 3D game inspired by *Temple Run*, developed in **Unity Engine 6**. Players take control of a **chibi snow leopard**, dashing through a stylized fantasy world filled with obstacles, environmental interactions, and dynamic challenges. The game features vibrant environments, smooth controls, and an immersive experience designed for endless fun.  

## **🌟 The Story of Frostpaw Dash**  
**Deep in the heart of the Frostveil Realm, a mystical land where magic flows through the air like drifting snowflakes, a young chibi snow leopard named Frostpaw embarks on an endless run.**  

Legends speak of the **Celestial Nexus**, an ancient artifact hidden within the forgotten ruins of time. It is said to hold the power to **restore balance** to the realm, but reaching it requires crossing treacherous landscapes filled with **crumbling paths, shifting bridges, and enchanted guardians** determined to keep its secrets hidden.  

One fateful night, the **Northern Lights pulse with an unknown energy**, awakening an ancient force deep beneath the Crystal Caverns. The ground trembles, the once-frozen paths begin to collapse, and glowing rune gates flicker open, revealing the way forward.  

With no time to waste, **Frostpaw dashes into the unknown**, dodging enchanted obstacles, navigating through mystical realms, and racing against time to uncover the truth behind the Celestial Nexus. The journey will test speed, agility, and courage—but Frostpaw must keep running… because something **dark and unseen** stirs in the shadows, ready to chase.
